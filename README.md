Hello there! Thank you for taking the time to look at my Capstone. As the title states, my project is focused on Food Deserts in the Nashville area. Upon moving closer to the city, I noticed that there was a lack of grocery stores in the area. I wondered if 1.) this was truly the case or wondered if my eyes were playing tricks on me and 2. I wondered how the lack of fruits and vegetables would affect individuals both physically and economically. With this analysis, I hope to find out if there is a  lack of fruits and vegetables in the Nashville area and if there is, how does it affect individuals, specifically our youth, and how we as a city can combat this issue.

*Questions asked prior to analysis*

1.) What age/race/gender typically reside in a food desert? ​

2.) Do lower income citizens have a higher rate of residing in a food desert or do higher income citizens have higher access to fruits and vegetables?​

3.) How does residing in a food desert have an affect on one's education?

*The Focus*

-Looked at student data that was specific to the Davidson county area ​

-Looked at grade levels ranging from Pre-K through the Twelfth Grade ​

-Did not include  Asian students given the small population ​

-Looked up Grocery Stores/ Supermarkets located in Davidson county- Used keywords "grocery" and "supermarket" to request data using Google API


*Tools Used-Process*

-Used Google API to retrieve Grocery store/Supermarket Data ​

-Broke up API searches based on Lat/Long of North, East, South, West areas of Davidson county​

-Used Python to clean up grocery store data and to create the Folium maps

-Used Tableau to create Color Gradient maps
